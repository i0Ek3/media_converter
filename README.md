## Why This Project?

I need to fetch my recordings from my Pixel phone, but its format is m4a, not mp3 or other formats. So I've decided to write something to help me convert this. Of course, thanks to pydub, I can solve this problem easily. Well, we'll keep updating this converter to make it support more conversion functions, but don't expect too much.



## Usage

Just click [here](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/85ac0ebe-233d-4087-b7ea-39d0c5729993) to use it.

~~Add your filename, savename and oformat in converter.py, and then run command `python3 audio_converter.py`~~.

~~For first version (Python), just run command `python3 media_converter.py` and then follows the steps.~~
